### Hey'all ðŸ‘‹

My name is Å Ã¡rka and I am doing my PhD jointly at Leibniz-Zentrum Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft and Radboud university (Donders Institute). In my research, I focus on dynamic signals such as motion and sound and how they contribute to emergence and negotiation of meaning.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a charade-like experiment in which people express meanings in different modalities.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning... how to be patient. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on how movement contribute to communication.
